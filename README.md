# Background
    Protein to protein interaction (PPI) is the basis of most biological processes and the main goal of therapeutic development. Great progress has been made in the prediction of PPI by protein docking and sequence analysis. However, docking usually requires a high-resolution structure of two binding partners, and sequence analysis requires a large number of repetitive patterns to identify potential binding sites. Researchers have turned to machine learning to overcome some of the limitations of other methods by using a set of descriptive function generalization interface sites. The best practices for data set generation, function and learning algorithm have not been determined or achieved, so it is necessary to analyze the overall efficiency of PPI prediction based on machine learning to highlight potential areas for improvement.
    Based on this, I put the research of my undergraduate years here, including protein composition, using pure Pytorch or DGL to implement the graph neural network model proposed in recent years and make corresponding improvements to apply to protein binding sites or other research in the field of protein.
    And record the list of papers that have been re examined in 2020 since the winter vacation. It is not easy to catch up with the pace of the times. We need to look ahead.
